## Game
The main purpose of this website is to play pong against other players and show everyone how good you are!
Therefor we should be able to play pong directly on the website and live against an other player.
It can be in a canvas or it can be with 3d effects, it can be ugly but it must be a pong like the one from 1972.
If you want to, you can add power ups, different maps etc... but user must be able to play a default pong game without any added stuff.
The game must be responsive!
Other users can watch the game live without interfering in it.
